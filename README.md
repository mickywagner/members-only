<h3>About This Project</h3>
<p>This website is a Members Only message board. Anyone can see the message board, but only members can see who posted them and only admins can 
delete messages. You must sign up and then enter a secret password to be given member status. The idea was to implement authentication and encrypt
passwords before storing them in the Mongo database.
I made for the NodeJS course on <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">Odin Project</a>
